# Use Kibana to display SD logs information

Kibana is the UI tool that allows you to explore and visualize over the SD log data added in Elasticsearch Cluster. The Elasticsearch tool serves as the database for the SD log data.

The main features of Kibana are data querying and analysis. Kibanaâ€™s visualization features allow you to display data using heat maps, line graphs, histograms and pie charts. With various methods, you can search the data stored in Elasticsearch for root cause diagnostics on the SD pods.

You can check if the SD logs indexes were created and stored in Elasticsearch using the Kibana web interface, to access to Kibana UI open the following URL in your browser:

    http://<kubernetes_cluster_ip>:30033/

where 30333 is the external port opened in a testing environment. For a production environment check with you K8S cluster administrator.
