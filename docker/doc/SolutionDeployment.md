# Solution Deployment Recommendations for Cloud Environments

When deploying Service Activator solutions on cloud environments several considerations need to be made. In particular, regarding deployment options, the following arguments should be used when deploying on cloud environments:

- `-conditionalDB`: this means database-related assets in a solution will be deployed only if the solution has not been deployed before (on any cluster node) or if the deployed version is inferior to the one being deployed. Since we cannot normally use different deployment options for different cluster nodes, the traditional approach of using a different option set for the first node where we are deploying the solution and the rest will not work.
- `-createTables`/`-writeDMversion`: in case the solution contains inventory beans, `-createTables` must be used to create the corresponding database tables as usual. Table creation will automatically be skipped if the solution is already deployed, so basically the first node to reach the deployment stage will create tables and the rest will skip it. In case the solution does not contain inventory beans and you don't need `-createTables` then you need to specify `-writeDMversion` to ensure the solution version is stored in the database so flags like `-conditionalDB` still work as expected.
- Depending on your work-flow and solution contents, you may also need to use some of the overwrite-related arguments. In particular for SD solutions we use `-overwriteAllOnConflict`.
- In case you are using rolling upgrade, you need to specify `-rollingUpgrade` for custom deployed solutions. If you want to build an image which can be deployed with or without rolling upgrade then you can control this using an environment variable. Of course your custom solutions must support rolling upgrade in order to do make use of this. Check the Service Director documentation for more information on rolling upgrade and current limitations.

For more information about deployment options you may check _Solution Separation and the Deployment Manager_ from the Service Activator product documentation set.
